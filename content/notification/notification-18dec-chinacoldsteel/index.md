📢 Industry Notification | Steel Sector Update

Date: 18 December 2025

Government of India has announced the proposal to impose additional duty on Cold Rolled Non-Oriented Electrical Steel (CRNO) imported from China, following concerns over dumped pricing in the Indian market.

The move aims to:

Protect domestic steel manufacturers

Address unfair pricing practices

Ensure a level playing field for Indian rolling mills and electrical steel producers

Chinese imports were reportedly entering the Indian market at prices significantly lower than fair market value, impacting local production, margins, and long-term capacity planning.

Impact on Industry:

Possible increase in landed cost of imported CRNO steel

Improved competitiveness for Indian manufacturers

Strategic opportunity for domestic mills to strengthen market presence

Rolling mills, OEMs, and electrical steel consumers are advised to closely monitor further notifications regarding final duty structure and implementation timelines.

Staying updated on such policy decisions is critical for procurement planning, pricing strategy, and production forecasting in the steel value chain.
